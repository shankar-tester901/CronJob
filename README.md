# CronJob
This is an example of how one can use Zoho Catalyst to create a Cron job which daily scrapes the web pages
of a site to fetch all NASA jobs with the location in GreenBelt.
If a job is available in GreenBelt, then one receives an email with the details of the job.

The idea is to avoid repetitive jobs using the Cron feature provided by Zoho Catalyst.
